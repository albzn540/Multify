# Multify React App
In here you can read about the Multify react app and it's scripts.
This app has been bootstrapped by create-react-app.

# How to run
## Firebase
This app uses firebase as the primary hosting service, both for the backend and the frontend. To start the frontend, you must have a firebase project. Follow this link and create one: https://console.firebase.google.com/  

## Spotify
To interact with Spotify you have to make a Spotify app, follow this link and create a new app. https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications

## Install dependencies
`$ npm install`

## Environmental variables
To get the app proparly working, copy .env.example and paste it as .env, after that you just add the required variables. You can find the firebase variables in the firebase project [console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and the spotify variables in Spotify developer [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

## Start the react app
`$ npm start`

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

First it runs the `npm run build` command and then `firebase deploy --only hosting` to deploy it to firebase.
Make sure you've installed and logged in with firebase-tools

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
